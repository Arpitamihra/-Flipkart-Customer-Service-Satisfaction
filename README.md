We built multiple ML models to predict engagement and evaluated them using metrics like RÂ² and MSE. After testing and hyperparameter tuning, the best model was selected based on performance. The chosen model can accurately predict engagement on new data, helping the business make informed content decisions, improve user experience, and optimize video strategies. The model is saved for deployment, ensuring it can be used for future predictions efficiently.
